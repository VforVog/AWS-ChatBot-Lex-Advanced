<hr>

- Access AWS Console. Use of Amazon Lex. Create ChatBot with basic configurations (IAM Roles and Idle session timeout, ..).

- Amazon Lex. Specify Intents and Slots. Define Response from Fulfillments, Closing Responses, etc.

- Time to connect Lambda. Integration of our python script. Validates Data Slots and provides Flexibility with customization in the specific needs.

- We connect Lambda function whereverâ€ƒwe want (in the Test chatbot and theâ€ƒspecific responses that we want).

- We make IAM role, in order to integateâ€ƒour chatbot to Kommunicate.

- We develop a simple UI Website. We host our â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒstatic website "index.html" to S3 Bucket.

- We do configurations on the S3 Bucket for â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒpublic access. It generates a URL link.

- Kommunicate generates a js script. We â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒimplement it in our html code.

- We now have the URL link. Our Website is â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒOnline. So we connect.

- We now make use of the ChatBot.

- Location: Ireland (So Amazon Lex can work)!
